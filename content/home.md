# Hessam Lotfalizadeh

**ML Researcher & Engineer**

I build scalable graph learning systems and develop novel algorithms for representation learning.

Recently completed my **PhD in Computer Engineering at Purdue University**, specializing in Graph Neural Networks and distributed ML systems. Currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at Indiana University exploring diffusion models for dynamic graphs.

I'm passionate about bridging theoretical research with production-grade implementations—from O(n²) → O(n log n) algorithmic improvements to enterprise systems handling millions of entities.
