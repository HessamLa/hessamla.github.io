# Hessam Alizadeh

(Hamidreza Lotfalizadeh, Ph.D.)\
**ML Researcher & Engineer**

I build scalable graph learning systems and develop novel algorithms for representation learning.

Recently completed my **PhD in Computer Engineering at Purdue University**, specializing in Graph ML and distributed ML systems. Currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at Indiana University exploring diffusion models for dynamic graphs.

I'm passionate about bridging theoretical research with production-grade implementations, algorithmic improvements, and scalable system design.
