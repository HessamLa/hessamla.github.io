# About Me

I'm an ML researcher and engineer specializing in **Graph Neural Networks** and **distributed machine learning systems**.

## Background

I completed my **PhD in Computer Engineering at Purdue University** in December 2024, where my research focused on kinematic-based force-directed graph embedding approaches. My doctoral work achieved significant algorithmic breakthroughs, including reducing computational complexity from O(n²) to O(n log n) while improving accuracy by 6% over state-of-the-art methods.

Currently, I'm a **Postdoctoral Researcher at Indiana University** under Dr. Mohammad Al Hasan, focusing on diffusion models for dynamic graphs and Graph Foundation Models.

## Research Interests

- Graph Neural Networks and Graph Foundation Models
- Diffusion models for dynamic graphs
- Force-directed graph embeddings and visualization
